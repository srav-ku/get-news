I have been part of CSI club in my university and participated some virtual internships

I want to grow in a challenging environment where I can learn new skills, solve problems, and contribute to my team. In the long run, I aim to take on responsibilities that make a real impact on the organization and clients.

I should be considered because I am hardworking, eager to learn, and able to work well in a team. I pay attention to detail and am committed to delivering quality work, which fits well with KPMGâ€™s values.
